# React Grunt Babel Theme

Starter code for transpiling ES2015 (including modules) with Babel, GRUNT and Browserify.


# Installing

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install -g grunt` to install Grunt globally.
3. `npm install -g webpack` to install Webpack globally
4. `npm install -g browserify` to install Browserify globally
5. `npm install` to resolve project dependencies.


### Browserify or Webpack ???
For now I'm testing both, for start I will be installing both of them.
How iÂ´m using Grunt, I installed the `grunt-browserify` and `grunt-webpack`

# Using
Run `grunt` + `plugin` from the command line and you are good to go!
